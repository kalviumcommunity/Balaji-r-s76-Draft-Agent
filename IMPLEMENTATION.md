1. **Accuracy**: Does the model output match the expected result exactly?
2. **Relevance**: Is the output contextually appropriate for the input?
3. **Consistency**: Does the model produce consistent results across similar inputs?"

## Implementation in Our Project
"In this project, we‚Äôve implemented an evaluation pipeline with the following components:
1. **Dataset**: A JSON file containing test cases with inputs and expected outputs.
2. **Judge Prompt**: A function to compare model outputs with expected results and return a judgment (Pass/Fail).
3. **Testing Framework**: A framework to run all test cases and generate a detailed report."

## Code Walkthrough
"Here‚Äôs how the evaluation pipeline works:

1. **Dataset Loading**: The pipeline loads test cases from a JSON file.
